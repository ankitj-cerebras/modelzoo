    Create a list of timesteps to use from an original diffusion process,
    given the number of timesteps we want to take from equally-sized portions
    of the original process.
    For example, if there's 300 timesteps and the section counts are [10,15,20]
    then the first 100 timesteps are strided to be 10 timesteps, the second 100
    are strided to be 15 timesteps, and the final 100 are strided to be 20.
    If the stride is a string starting with "ddim", then the fixed striding
    from the DDIM paper is used, and only one section is allowed.
    :param num_timesteps: the number of diffusion steps in the original
                          process to divide up.
    :param section_counts: either a list of numbers, or a string containing
                           comma-separated numbers, indicating the step count
                           per section. As a special case, use "ddimN" where N
                           is a number of steps to use the striding from the
