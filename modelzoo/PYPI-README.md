## Introduction

This repository contains examples of common deep learning models that can be trained on Cerebras hardware. These models demonstrate the best practices for coding a model targeted at the Cerebras hardware so that you can take full advantage of this new powerful compute engine.

In order to get started with running your models on a Cerebras system, please refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.cerebras.net/en/latest/index.html) along with this readme.

**NOTE**: If you are interested in trying out Cerebras Model Zoo on Cerebras Hardware (CS-2 Systems), we offer the following options:

- Academics - Please fill out our Partner Hardware Access Request form [here](https://www.cerebras.net/developers/partner-hardware-access-request/) and we will contact you about gaining access to a system from one of our partners.
- Commercial - Please fill out our Get Demo form [here]( https://www.cerebras.net/get-demo/) so that our team can provide you with a demo and discuss access to our system.
- For all others - Please contact us at developer@cerebras.net.

For a list of all supported models, please check [models in this repository](#models-in-this-repository).
