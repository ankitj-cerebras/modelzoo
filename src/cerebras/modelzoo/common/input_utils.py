    Batch the data from an iterator such that sampels of similar length end
    up in the same batch. If `buckets` is not supplied, then this just batches
    the dataset normally.

    :param data_iterator: An iterater that yields data one sample at a time.
    :param int batch_size: The number of samples in a batch.
    :param list buckets: A list of bucket boundaries. If set to None, then no
        bucketing will happen, and data will be batched normally. If set to
        a list, then data will be grouped into `len(buckets) + 1` buckets. A
        sample `s` will go into bucket `i` if
        `buckets[i-1] <= element_length_fn(s) < buckets[i]` where 0 and inf are
        the implied lowest and highest boundaries respectively. `buckets` must
        be sorted and all elements must be non-zero.
    :param callable element_length_fn: A function that takes a single sample and
        returns an int representing the length of that sample.
    :param callable collate_fn: The function to use to collate samples into a
        batch. Defaults to PyTorch's default collate function.
    :param bool drop_last: Whether or not to drop incomplete batches at the end
        of the dataset. If using bucketing, buckets that are not completely full
        will also be dropped, even if combined there are more than `batch_size`
        samples remaining spread across multiple buckets.
    :param int seed: If using `drop_last = False`, we don't want to feed out
        leftover samples with order correlated to their lengths. The solution
        is to shuffle the leftover samples before batching and yielding them.
        This seed gives the option to make this shuffle deterministic. It is
        only used when `buckets` is not `None` and `drop_last = True`.

    :yields: Batches of samples of type returned by `collate_fn`, or batches of
        PyTorch tensors if using the default collate function.
